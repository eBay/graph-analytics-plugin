# Contributing to opentracing-basic

First, thank you for considering contributing to this project!

We welcome contributions and have provided a guide to help make this is as straightforward as
possible.

## Steps

1. [Raise an Issue](#raise-an-issue)
1. [Write code](#write-code)
1. [Submit pull request](#submit-pull-request)

## Raise an Issue

Before starting development please look at the existing issues to ensure that your concern or
improvement  is not already being addressed.  This is important to prevent conflicting work.

If no issues already match your intentions raise an issue with sufficient detail as to what you
intend to do.  The issue can then become a place where discussion relating to the problem
statement and intended approach can be had.

This step is critical in ensuring that owners are aware of and can provide feedback on incoming
changes.

This helps eliminate duplicate work, conflicting work, or any other unintended consequences.

## Write code

All code should conform to the project's code style.  This project follows the
[Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).

All work intended for release should be committed against the `main` branch.

Work will not be considered complete unless it is in a publishable, production-ready
state.  This restriction is in place to ensure that the library can be published when
needed without delay.

### Tests

Every bug fix or change should be accompanied by corresponding tests.  These tests are
important both to protect the quality of the library as well as to demonstrate scenarios
that the change impacts.

## Submit pull request

Submit a PR  to merge the code into the `main` branch and assign to one or more
owners for review.

The PR should reference the issue being worked on and contain a description that is
useful for understanding the implementation details.

Once a PR is approved, it will likely be merged to `main`.

If your change is time-sensitive, please indicate this fact in a comment on the
PR.  The project owners will do their best to publish a release containing your change
as soon as possible.
